Easily redirect your old College Publisher URLs to your WordPress URLs.

== Description ==

CP Redirect allows you to easily redirect old College Publisher URLs like these:

* media/storage/paper522/news/2009/05/07/News/Su.Graduate.Student.Falls.Drowns.In.Local.Lake-3749205.shtml
* sports/predicting-the-leader-of-the-pac-in-2009-1.236091

to your shiny new WordPress URLs. For this to work properly, you must have the College Publisher article ID stored in a custom field, or set as the new post ID when you imported all of your content.

*Important:* Version 0.1.1 is a beta release that hasn't been tested very thoroughly. If you run into a quirk, we'll try to fix it asap

2. Upload cp-redirect folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
3. Activate CP Redirect on the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress administration.
