Also you can add urls for exlude of maintenance mode.

Use the shortcode `[loginform]` for easy use a login form on the maintenance page.

### Adding Custom CSS
In plugin settings, choose the "Own CSS Style" in the CSS Style dropdown. Then enter the full URL to your stylesheet in the textbox underneath.

### Custom HTML
You can add your own html by dropping a `wp-maintenance-mode.php` file in the wp-content folder. It will automatically be used instead of the default html.
The default html Markup and my source for countdown and more find you in the `site.php` inside the plugin folder of this plugin.

### Custom Content
You can also add content via these hook:

 * `wm_head` - hook inside the head of the maintenance mode site
 * `wm_content` - hook over the content, after the div with id content
 * `wm_footer` - hook inside the footer


**Example:**
	
	function add_my_link() {
		echo '<a href="http://mylink.com/">My Link</a>
	}
	add_action( 'wm_footer', 'add_my_link' );

More hooks for meta data inside the head. The `<meta>` tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but will be machine parsable. You can change the data for 3 different meta data values:

 * `wm_meta_author` - Define the author of a page
 * `wm_meta_description` - Define a description of your web page
 * `wm_meta_keywords` - Define keywords for search engines

More hooks for other data, if the settings possibilities is not enough.
