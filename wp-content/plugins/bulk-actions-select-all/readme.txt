Adds an option to the admin posts overview to select all posts (instead of just posts on the current page) to bulk delete/restore posts. Supports CPTs.

== Description ==

Bulk Actions For All Posts adds an option to the posts overview in the WordPress Admin to select "All Posts". By default, WordPress only allows you to select the posts on the current page.

= Supported content types =
The plugin works for posts, pages and custom post types. At this point, it doesn't support terms, comments and other object types besides posts, pages and custom post types. However, we might add these options in the future.

== Installation ==

For automatic installation, all you have to do is install and activate the plugin from the Plugins screen in your WordPress admin panel!

For manual installation, please download the plugin and follow these steps:

1. Upload the folder `bulk-actions-select-all` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. An option to select all posts now appears when you click the "Select all" checkbox in the posts overview header
1. After clicking "Select all [x] entries", you can apply any bulk action you want, and it's applied on "all" posts!

== Screenshots ==

1. When clicking on the "Select all" checkbox in the top left of your posts table, a notice appears to select all posts
